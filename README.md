# spam_mail_classifier

An end-to-end Python pipeline for detecting spam emails using feature selection, SMOTE balancing, and hyperparameter-tuned classifiers.  
Outputs cross-validation & test accuracies (in %), confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC.

## Overview

`spam_mail_classifier` loads a CSV of engineered numeric email features, imputes missing values, scales them into [0,1], and selects the most informative predictors via a chi-squared test. It balances the training set with SMOTE, then compares and tunes two modelsâ€”Logistic Regression and Random Forestâ€”using stratified GridSearchCV. Finally, it reports both CV and hold-out test metrics, including accuracy (%), confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Data Imputation**: Automatically fills in missing numeric values with column means.  
- **Scaling & Selection**: Scales features into [0,1] and selects the top *k* predictors via chi-squared tests.  
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Uses SMOTE to synthesize minority-class samples and balance the training set.  
- **Model Comparison & Tuning**: Runs a stratified `GridSearchCV` over Logistic Regression and Random Forest hyperparameters.  
- **Metrics & Reporting**: Outputs CV accuracy and test accuracy (as percentages), confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC.
